Dear Professor Wood,


My name is Zifan, and I'm a senior majoring in M.S. CS at GWU. I'm nearing the end of my degree, and I have begun to consider possible research labs for continuing my studies as a PhD student.

I was looking at your website and found the idea behind your ongoing project on mobile security to be fascinating. I also have taken your Distributed System course last term and completed it with a project implementing a basic distributed cache system using Golang.

My undergraduate thesis is analyzing and simulating cyberattacks on VANET (Vehicular ad-hoc network) in different scenarios. The limitation of vehicular network performance and the relevance between VANET and Clouds made me consider the possibility of cloud computing and 5G. Therefore, I have taken several courses during the master's program related to this area, such as network cybersecurity, wireless and mobile security, and data compression. I have read dozens paper and discuss with my classmates. And I completed the course with a survey on DNS security enhancement.

Please let me know if there is a possible opening for a research assistant in your lab in the upcoming term. I would be happy to answer any questions and provide further information. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,
Zifan Qu
