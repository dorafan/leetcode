Dear professor Pless,
    My name is Zifan Qu, an M.S. CS student in GWU. I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from your courses and teaching materials. I was hoping that you might have a high enough regard for my abilities to write a general recommendation for my credentials file.
    I am targeting a Ph.D. program focusing on cybersecurity and distributed systems.  Therefore, I have taken Cryptography, Computer Security, and Distributed Systems courses to augment my background. I also take some related courses like Data Compression and Wireless Security to expand my horizons. The grades of all courses are A. 
    I have tried to improve my academic skills and critical thinking too. Since my undergraduate academic thesis analyzes and simulates the Vehicular Ad hoc Network and cyberattacks on its vulnerabilities, I choose Wireless Security to discuss dozens of latest papers in IoT, mobile security, and cloud security with my professor and classmates. The course ended successfully with a survey on DNS security enhancement. That helps me to have a clear understanding of the recent research trends. 
I know it is not a good time to apply for Ph.D. right before graduation. Especially in a hard time influenced by Covid 19. However, after persuaded my family, I have finally decided to go further on studying and researching security and cloud technologies.  
    Please let me know if you are comfortable endorsing my candidacy for Ph.D. application. I would be happy to answer any questions and provide further information which will help you to write your recommendation.
    Thanks so much for all you have done for me and for taking the time to review this request. 

Sincerely, 
Zifan Qu
