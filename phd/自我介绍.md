My name is Zifan Qu. I am a master student at GWU, and my interest is IoT and mobile security. 

I have done  simulation of DDoS attack on VANET during my undergraduate program, and that makes me want to go further on research in security and IoT. 

During my graduate study, I have learned basic ML, Computer security, and have done research with my professor in mobile security. I read paper in wireless and mobile security every week and disscuss with my professor and classmates. I also present one of my interestest paper and complete the course with a survey with my teammates. 

I also study courses in other area such like data compression, and have use matlab to implement some image compression algorithm. 

I'm willing to analyze and do research in IoT security, also security in ML.  And I hope I could use the knowledge and research results in practice in the future.
