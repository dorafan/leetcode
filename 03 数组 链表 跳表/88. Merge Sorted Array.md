## 88  Merge Sorted Array

Easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/

Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively. You may assume that `nums1` has a size equal to `m + n` such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from `nums2`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m + n`

- `nums2.length == n`

- `0 <= m, n <= 200`

- `1 <= m + n <= 200`

- `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109`

```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int[] nums1copy = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            nums1copy[i] = nums1[i];
        }
        
        int j = 0;
        int k = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m+n; i++) {
            if (k >= n) {
                nums1[i] = nums1copy[j++];
            } else if (j < m && nums1copy[j] <= nums2[k]) {
                nums1[i] = nums1copy[j++];
            } else {
                nums1[i] = nums2[k++];
            }
        }
          
    }
}
```

#### Approach 1 : Three Pointers (Start From the Beginning)

**Intuition**

Because each array is already sorted, we can achieve an \mathcal{O}(n + m)O(*n*+*m*) time complexity with the help of the *two-pointer technique*.

**Algorithm**

The simplest implementation would be to make a *copy* of the values in `nums1`, called `nums1Copy`, and then use two **read** pointers and one **write** pointer to read values from `nums1Copy` and `nums2` and write them into `nums1`.

- Initialize `nums1Copy` to be a new array containing the first `m` values of `nums1`.

- Initialize read pointer `p1` to the beginning of `nums1Copy`.

- Initialize read pointer `p2` to the beginning of `nums2`.

- Initialize write pointer `p` to the beginning of `nums1`.

- While

   

  ```
  p
  ```

   

  is still within

   

  ```
  nums1
  ```

  :

  - If

     

    ```
    nums1Copy[p1]
    ```

     

    exists and is less than or equal to

     

    ```
    nums2[p2]
    ```

    :

    - Write `nums1Copy[p1]` into `nums1[p]`, and increment `p1` by `1`.

  - Else

    - Write `nums2[p2]` into `nums1[p]`, and increment `p2` by `1`.

  - Increment `p` by `1`.

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : \mathcal{O}(n + m)O(*n*+*m*).

  We are performing n + 2 \cdot m*n*+2⋅*m* reads and n + 2 \cdot m*n*+2⋅*m* writes. Because constants are ignored in Big O notation, this gives us a time complexity of \mathcal{O}(n + m)O(*n*+*m*).

- Space complexity : \mathcal{O}(m)O(*m*).

  We are allocating an additional array of length m*m*.
