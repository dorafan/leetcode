## 189  Rotate Array

Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by *k* steps, where *k* is non-negative.

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`



## 第一次

暴力， 每一次把最末尾的移到首位，然后数组内部一次向后挪动一位，循环k次

#### Approach 1 ： Brute Force

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int temp, prev;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            prev = nums[nums.length - 1];
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
                temp = nums[j];
                nums[j] = prev;
                prev = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity: 
  $$
  \mathcal{O}(n \times k)
  $$
  . All the numbers are shifted by one step(O(*n*)) k times.

- Space complexity: O(1). No extra space is used.
