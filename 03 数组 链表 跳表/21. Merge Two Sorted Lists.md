## 21  Merge Two Sorted Lists

Easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

#### Approach 2: Iteration

去看解析，双指针，注意加一个额外的prev指针，定值-1，比较两个指针，然后把prev连过来，不要再用next了

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        // maintain an unchanging reference to node ahead of the return node.
        ListNode prehead = new ListNode(-1);

        ListNode prev = prehead;
        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val <= l2.val) {
                prev.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {
                prev.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            prev = prev.next;
        }

        // At least one of l1 and l2 can still have nodes at this point, so connect
        // the non-null list to the end of the merged list.
        prev.next = l1 == null ? l2 : l1;

        return prehead.next;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(n + m)*O*(*n*+*m*)

  Because exactly one of `l1` and `l2` is incremented on each loop iteration, the `while` loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the sum of the lengths of the two lists. All other work is constant, so the overall complexity is linear.

- Space complexity : O(1)*O*(1)

  The iterative approach only allocates a few pointers, so it has a constant overall memory footprint.





#### Approach 1: Recursion

**Intuition**

We can recursively define the result of a `merge` operation on two lists as the following (avoiding the corner case logic surrounding empty lists):

\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} list1[0] + merge(list1[1:], list2) & list1[0] < list2[0] \\ list2[0] + merge(list1, list2[1:]) & otherwise \end{array} \right.{*l**i**s**t*1[0]+*m**e**r**g**e*(*l**i**s**t*1[1:],*l**i**s**t*2)*l**i**s**t*2[0]+*m**e**r**g**e*(*l**i**s**t*1,*l**i**s**t*2[1:])*l**i**s**t*1[0]<*l**i**s**t*2[0]*o**t**h**e**r**w**i**s**e*

Namely, the smaller of the two lists' heads plus the result of a `merge` on the rest of the elements.

**Algorithm**

We model the above recurrence directly, first accounting for edge cases. Specifically, if either of `l1` or `l2` is initially `null`, there is no merge to perform, so we simply return the non-`null` list. Otherwise, we determine which of `l1` and `l2` has a smaller head, and recursively set the `next` value for that head to the next merge result. Given that both lists are `null`-terminated, the recursion will eventually terminate.

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(n + m)*O*(*n*+*m*)

  Because each recursive call increments the pointer to `l1` or `l2` by one (approaching the dangling `null` at the end of each list), there will be exactly one call to `mergeTwoLists` per element in each list. Therefore, the time complexity is linear in the combined size of the lists.

- Space complexity : O(n + m)*O*(*n*+*m*)

  The first call to `mergeTwoLists` does not return until the ends of both `l1` and `l2` have been reached, so n + m*n*+*m* stack frames consume O(n + m)*O*(*n*+*m*) space.
