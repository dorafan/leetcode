Dear professor Youssef,  
     My name is Zifan Qu, an M.S. CS student at GWU. I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from your Data compression course and teaching materials last term. I was hoping that you might have a high enough regard for my abilities to write a general recommendation for my credentials file. 


​    I am targeting a Ph.D. program in Spring 2022, focusing on cybersecurity and distributed systems. Therefore, I have taken Cryptography, Computer Security, and Distributed Systems courses to augment my background. I also take some related courses like Wireless Security and Data Compression to expand my horizons. The grades are all A.   

​    I have tried to improve my academic skills and critical thinking too. Since my undergraduate academic thesis analyzes and simulates the Vehicular Ad hoc Network and cyberattacks on its vulnerabilities, I choose Wireless Security to discuss dozens of latest papers in IoT, mobile security, and cloud security with my professor and classmates. The course ended successfully with a survey on DNS security enhancement. That helps me to have a clear understanding of the recent research trends.  

​    I know it is not a good time to apply for Ph.D. right before graduation. Especially in a difficult period influenced by Covid 19. But what I learned at GWU helped me make the decision. I  didn't realize that data compression had been used so widely before taking your course.  Therefore,  I really hope to have an opportunity to explore existed technologies and future possibilities of my interest area, just like what I learned in your class.

​    Please let me know if you are comfortable endorsing my candidacy for a Ph.D. application. I would be happy to answer any questions and provide further information which will help you to write your recommendation. 

​    Thank s so much for all you have done for me and for taking the time to review this request. 

Sincerely,  
Zifan Qu
